			Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity which is the science behind what we now know
			about the ever growing and malleable nature of the mind, helps oneself to grasp the concepts
			that our minds are forever growing, changing and getting better. Intelligence for example is not
			a predetermined fixed state of mind, but something that with practice can be nurtured and
			encouraged, the mind with its adaptable nature can like any muscle in the body can become
			stronger, new skills can be learnt, even mastered at any stage in one's life. Although it is
			something that I knew of personally the principles of neuroplasticity was not something I would
			think of often, in fact I had somewhat resigned to the fact that I was too old to learn anything
			new.

			In shaking off the stigma of failure and the lack of belief in my own capabilities, what I have
			come to know as having a “fixed mindset”. I believe now after extensive research into
			neuroplasticity and “growth mindset” that this is in fact not the case. My mind is capable of
			far more than I gave it credit for. Knowing these facts regarding my mind helps to keep me
			focused and at the very least assured that even though I may struggle at times during this
			journey I will prevail so long as I remain committed to the path and trust in my amazing ever
			evolving plastic brain… to paraphrase Carol Dweck I will endeavour to embrace the potential yet,
			and shake off the tyranny of now.

			The culmination of this research has born in me a renewed faith in my own capabilities. I still
			need to refine and tweak what tools and techniques specifically resonate with my mind the most.
			Ultimately however this knowledge gives me hope for my future, change is possible, I am not
			limited, I'm ready and more than capable for the journey ahead, what was once trepidation is now
			replaced with anticipation for what lies ahead.
