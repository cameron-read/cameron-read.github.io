			EDA Sprint 5-CORE-foundations-reflections
		</h1>

		<h2 class="headers-side">
			What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?
		</h2>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			That my ego has changed dramatically since having a child. I have been humbled by the
			experience and I have realised that obsession and negative focus on self has no place in my life
			now that I'm a father. -That I harbour fear, that is intrinsic to my perceived ability, or lack
			thereof. -Hope, although small at present does in fact reside in me, I hold onto this moving
			forward believing that this experience will help me change my life for the better. For me and
			more importantly my family
		</p>

		<h3 class="headers-side">
			What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
		</h3>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			These are all linked to one's emotional intelligence, and play a huge role in oneâ€™s professional
			and personal life. They help foster strong relationships and positive work environments, not to
			mention assist greatly in the well being of one's own mental health, maintaining good practice
			and training your emotional intelligence is essential both professionally and personally.
		</p>

		<h4 class="headers-side">
			What has surprised you the most about core learning?
		</h4>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			Personal reflection and analysis. Reflecting on my own core nature helped identify problems in
			myself that I had previously not known the case of.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			Confronting my own fears regarding learning and my own ability.
		</p>

		<h6 class="headers-side">
			Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning
			in a web development Bootcamp course?
		</h6>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			Because the two are linked and benefit each other, helping your students to become better
			programmers, team members and people in general.
		</p>

		<h6 class="headers-side">
			Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
			just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
		</h6>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			No, I think it's essential. Both schools of learning are beneficial professionally and
			personally. I believe a strong mindset at its core is directly linked to your ability to learn.
