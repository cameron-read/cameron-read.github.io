  <p class="paragraphs-side">

  I'm striving to get my coding and web development skills to a strong professional level, allowing me to confidently enter the workforce sooner rather than later.
  Im would like to further develop my team working and communication skills. I am really looking forward to working together with like minded people towards a common goal and product. I believe these skills to be invaluable and I am ecstatic to have an opportunity to develop them further.

<h5 class="headers-side"> my commitment </h5>

<p class="paragraphs-side">

I have taken great care with my work environment ensuring I have everything I need to work productively from equipment to my study space. I have also ensured that I have time to commit to this endeavour, I have completely cleared my schedule so I can focus totally on this course. In doing soI have allowed myself the time to work, and given myself the freedom of attention that is required when I collaborate and learn from other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.When things inevitably get stressful, I intend to employ my own meditation and yoga practice to help keep me calm and focused. Also I want to create balance between study and time for myself and family, this will include among other things an exercise regime. It is my belief and experience that keeping your body strong affects your mental capacity in a very positive way.
