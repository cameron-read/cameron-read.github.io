		</h4>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			I'm striving to get my coding and web development skills to a strong professional level,
			allowing me to confidently enter the workforce sooner rather than later. Im would like to
			further develop my team working and communication skills. I am really looking forward to working
			together with like minded people towards a common goal and product. I believe these skills to be
			invaluable and I am ecstatic to have an opportunity to develop them further.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			my commitment
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			I have taken great care with my work environment ensuring I have everything I need to work
			productively from equipment to my study space. I have also ensured that I have time to commit to
			this endeavour, I have completely cleared my schedule so I can focus totally on this course. In
			doing soI have allowed myself the time to work, and given myself the freedom of attention that
			is required when I collaborate and learn from other learners, facilitators and
			industry/community representatives.When things inevitably get stressful, I intend to employ my
			own meditation and yoga practice to help keep me calm and focused. Also I want to create balance
			between study and time for myself and family, this will include among other things an exercise
			regime. It is my belief and experience that keeping your body strong affects your mental
			capacity in a very positive way.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			To attain the technical ability and core mindset to confidently finas employment within the
			industry. Also to have the ability to create and maintain my own web projects. To make a
			positive difference for me and my family.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			For better or worse I believe my strengths and limitations remain the same as they always have
			throughout this process so far. It will be something I need to focus on during bootcamp. However
			the skills I have acquired both core and technical will serve me well. I just need to remain
			focused and trust in myself.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			I think my biggest challenge will be my time management, ensuring that I have allocated enough
			time for both the course and my family will be y masin priority.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at
			Dev Academy?
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			I want to develop my interpersonal relationship skills within a professional environment, so I
			can become better at being part of a team and maybe one day leading one.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			Just to be there, which is already happening and I believe it will continue into bootcamp. It is
			very comforting to know that you are supported and help is there when I will need it. I know for
			me bootcamp is going to be challenging and i know I will need a lot of help, I'm just so
			grateful it will be there.
		</p>

		<h5 class="headers-side">
			What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
		</h5>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			To remain positive and supportive of myself and with other learners, facilitators and
			industry/community representatives. I intend to use all the skills I have learnt throughout
			foundations, such as meditation and reflection to keep myself grounded and positive. I will also
			ask for help when I need it, and not lean on past behavioural tendencies and stew on problems
			both technical and emotional for too long.
