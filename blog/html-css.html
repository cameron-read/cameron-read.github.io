  <h2 class="headers-side"> classes vs. ids, what is the difference? </h2>

  <p class="paragraphs-side"> 
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. while an ID applies a style to one unique element.
    In CSS , selectors are used to focus on a specific element or range of elements on a  page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
    Two of the most commonly used are class and ID . Both are used to focus on elements to which a style should be applied.

  <h3 class="headers-side"> Class selector </h3>

  <p class="paragraphs-side"> 

    A class selector allows you to define style rules that apply to any element with a class attribute equal to a certain value.
    As we discussed earlier, the ID selector can only be used to style one element. This is because IDs can only be used once on a web page. Classes, on the other hand, can be used across multiple elements. So, if you apply a style using a class selector, any element which shares that class will be subject to the styles you define.
    Class selectors are defined using a ".", followed by the value of the class that you want to apply a set of styles to. Here is an example showing the CSS and HTML when using a Class selector:

  </p>

  <div>
    <img src="../class-example.jpg" class="center">
  </div>

  <h1 class="headers-side"> ID Selector </h1>

  <p class="paragraphs-side">

    The id selector enables you to define style rules that apply to a single element on the web page. Each web page can only have one element with a single ID attribute . This means the ID selector cannot be used to style more than one element.
    ID selectors are defined using a "#" sign. Then they are followed by the ID value that you want to apply a set of style rules to. Here is an example showing the CSS and HTML when using a ID selector: 

  </p>

  <div>
    <img src="../ID-example.jpg" class="center">
  </div>

  <h1 class="headers-side"> In Conclusion </h1>

  <p class="paragraphs-side">

    so it is widely assumed that there are no situations where it is mandatory for you to use either a class or an id. although it is recomended to only use IDs if you want a style to apply to a single element on a web page, and to use classes in the event you want a style to apply to several elements.
