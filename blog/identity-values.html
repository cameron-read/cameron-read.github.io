  <p class="paragraphs-side"> 

    During my previous career as a hospitality consultant deciding whether to advocate for and operate my business sustainably.
    I weighed the decision on a scale that compared my core beliefs relating to sustainability and how they related to my businessâ€™s financial success, initially these seemed in direct conflict.
    I chose to move my business to a sustainable model.
    This did dictate to an extent the kind of clients I took on. initially hampering my businesses profitability. However in time my ethical choice to move my business garnered a client base that was more inline with my core beliefs surrounding sustainability.

  <p class="paragraphs-side"> 

    When I was organising a large Christmas event at a high-end hotel during my career as a hospitality consultant, I ran into resistance from one of the owners when deciding the best way to proceed with an operational aspect of the event.
    This owner was particularly strong willed and opinionated, always believing himself to be correct and rarely listened to anyone.
    In this situation, I decided the best way forward was to placate to his demands even though I knew it would not work out, with the intention of rectifying things when the operation invariably failed on the fly.
    This did not make my job easier in fact it definitely made it harder, however it avoided an inevitable time consuming confrontation with the owner. In this situation I think given my time over I would take the confrontation with the owner and sort the issues prior to the event, perhaps come to a compromise that sees the event moving forward more smoothly than it did.
