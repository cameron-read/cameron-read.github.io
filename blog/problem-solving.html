		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			I would say in all honesty that I was blocked a lot on this set of challenges. However to name a
			particular problem, I would say that Fizz Buzz definitely presented a significant hurdle. I
			would also be the first to say that I understood what we were trying to tell the computer to do.
			Ergo, I understood the game. However the code required to achieve this, for me, was nowhere to
			be found. It was with much trepidation, extensive research and in no small part having a lot of
			help from our resident angel Johnny that I was able to blunder my way through Fizz Buzz. I don't
			believe elegant would ever be an adjective I would use to describe any of my solutions at this
			point. Ultimately, blissful would be the way I would describe my disposition upon completing this set of
			challenges, but in terms of reflecting on my technical prowess at this stage, I feel it is
			lacking…elegant problem solving seems a very distant achievement at this juncture. I learned
			fundamentally that I have a lot to learn...the journey continues.

			reflect- problem solving techniques
		</h3>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			-Pseudocode- I have begun to use this, it is helpful in that it keeps me on track and presents
			my desired outcome, I really want to get more confident with this technique.
		</p>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			-Trying something & reading error messages- this has for better or worse been one of my
			predominant forms of problem solving. The error messages if you take time with them can be very
			helpful in identifying holes and mistakes in your code.
		</p>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			-rubber ducky method- this has on occasion garnered me a solution to a problem. Just telling
			someone what is happening has surprising benefits when you are stuck. I would like to employ
			this technique more as I believe it helps to access latent knowledge I did not realise I have.
		</p>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			-console.loggin’- I find this to be super helpful. I'm getting more confident with using it as I
			move forward. Testing your code safely and regularly is invaluable
		</p>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			-googling- is without a doubt my most used problem solving technique. I get better daily at
			being able to articulate my problem and more and more I’m getting better results from my
			searches.
		</p>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			-Getting help from my peers- I have been so impressed and humbled by the helpful and exceedingly
			knowledgeable students I study alongside with. I have found them to be unendingly kind and
			helpful through this whole process thus far, it has been a joy and an honour to share it with
			them.
		</p>

		<p class="paragraphs-side">
			-getting help from facilitators-where to begin, they are saints. Truly helpful. The way they
			guide you to solutions is amazing, I often know more than I thought I did, and on so many
			occasions it has been a facilitator who has helped me to realise this.
